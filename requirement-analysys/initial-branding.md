## 1. Brand Identity

### App Name

**FocusLog**

### Tagline (pick one)

* *Focus. Speak. Review.*
* *Your work, in your own words.*
* *Log your focus, not just your time.*

### Brand Personality

* Calm, intentional, analytical
* Not “gamified”
* Built for people who **care about improving**, not just tracking

---

## 2. Visual Identity

### Color Palette (Minimal + Serious)

**Primary**

* Midnight Blue — `#0F172A` (focus, depth)
* Soft White — `#F8FAFC`

**Accent**

* Calm Green — `#22C55E` (completion, success)
* Amber — `#F59E0B` (interruptions / breaks)

**Why this works**

* Dark UI friendly (long focus sessions)
* Green/Amber map naturally to *flow vs interruption*
* Looks premium, not playful

---

### Typography

**Primary Font**

* Inter (or SF Pro on iOS)

**Usage**

* Medium / Semibold only
* No decorative fonts
* Voice is the hero, not visuals

---

## 3. Logo Direction (Simple & Modern)

**Concept**

* A circular “record” dot + checkmark or pause bars
* Symbolizes:

  * 🎙️ voice
  * ⏱️ time
  * ✅ completion

**Examples**

* Solid dot → recording
* Ring → Pomodoro cycle
* Minimal mark that scales to app icon

If you want next, I can **generate an actual logo SVG concept**.
