**Tone**

* Reflective
* Respectful
* Low pressure

**Rule**

> If the user says “not now”, they should still like the app.

---

## Paywall Trigger Points (Important)

Show the paywall **only when value is obvious**:

1. After viewing **Daily Review** (end of day)
2. When opening **Weekly Review**
3. When enabling **Cloud Sync**
4. When tapping **Web Dashboard** (locked)

Never show it:

* On app launch
* During focus
* During breaks

---

## Paywall Screen Layout (Single Screen)

### Top Section — Value Statement

**Title**

> **Understand your focus**

**Subtitle**

> Turn your Pomodoro logs into clear, personal insights.

---

### Middle Section — What You Get (Bullet-Light)

Use **short, concrete benefits**, not feature jargon.

✅ Daily focus summaries
✅ Weekly patterns & trends
✅ Break effectiveness insights
✅ Distraction themes
✅ Cloud sync & backup
✅ Web dashboard access
✅ Export your data

*(No icons needed — text is calmer)*

---

### Highlight Box (Key Differentiator)

> **No scores. No judgment.**
> Just an honest view of how you work.

This line is powerful — keep it.

---

### Pricing Section

**Primary (Recommended)**

> **₹1999 / year**
> *Less than ₹6/day*

**Secondary**

> ₹249 / month

Annual should be visually emphasized:

* Slight border
* “Best value” tag (small, subtle)

---

### Primary CTA

**Button**

> **Unlock Pro**

Color:

* Calm green
* Not aggressive

---

### Secondary Actions (Important for Trust)

Below CTA, smaller text buttons:

* *Continue with Free*
* *Restore purchase*

No dark patterns.

---

## Optional: Trial Strategy (Recommended)

### 7-Day Pro Trial (No Card or With Card)

**Copy**

> Try Pro free for 7 days.
> Cancel anytime.

If no trial:

> One-time upgrade. Cancel anytime.

---

## Confirmation Copy (After Upgrade)

> **Pro unlocked.**
> You’ll now see daily summaries and weekly insights.

No confetti.
No celebration spam.

---

## Why This Paywall Will Convert

* It appears **after value is felt**
* It sells **clarity**, not features
* It respects the user’s intelligence
* It aligns with the product philosophy

This is how serious productivity tools earn trust.

---

## Optional Enhancements (Later)

* Show **1 real sample insight** (blurred)
* Add “Used by people who value deep work” (no fake stats)
* Annual-only plan for simplicity (later)

---

## Final Checkpoint ✅

If this paywall feels:

* Calm ✔️
* Honest ✔️
* Worth paying for ✔️

Then the **product is monetization-ready**.
